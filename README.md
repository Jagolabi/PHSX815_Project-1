# Dice roller

These programs are available in this repository:

* DiceAnalysis.py [Python]
* DiceRoll.py [Python]

# Utilization

The usage of two separate plotting libraries necessitates independent download, setup, and installation by users.

* matplotlib (python)
* numpy       (pyhon)

# Example usage

* matplotlib (python)

The python file `DiceAnalysis.py` can be run from the command line by typing:

`<> python DiceAnalysis.py`

This requires a working `Python` distribution (so that the python executable exists) with the Python package `numpy` and `Matplotlib` also installed.
